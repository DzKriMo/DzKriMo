### 🚗 Porsche Meets Code

If coding were driving, **debugging is cornering at high speed**, and **deploying a stable model** feels like hitting 300 km/h on the Autobahn.

Because like my favorite Porsche — **the 911 GT3RS** — I strive for **power, precision, and reliability** in every project.

### ⚡ Fun Fact

When I’m not securing networks or optimizing neural nets,  
I’m probably analyzing car engines, watching F1 highlights, or tuning datasets instead of Porsches.
